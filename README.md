* Work on the tuesday (V || F)
* Work on the thursday  (V || F)

Condition: If the two jobs works,
you will buy a 50-inch television on the weekend, 
If just one job work, will buy a 32-inch television
If both jobs work, will buy an ice cream.
But If both jobs don't work, the family will stay home.
And finally a denial.
